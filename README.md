# Multiple Linear Regression - Real Estate Pricing

This project demonstrates a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict real estate prices based on two features: size and year.

## Dataset

- **File**: `real estate price size year.csv`
- **Columns**:
  - `size`: Size of the property
  - `year`: Construction year
  - `price`: Sale price (target)

## Objective

Train a regression model using `statsmodels` to:
- Analyze the relationship between size/year and price.
- Interpret coefficients and model fit from the summary.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
